# Astro Cloud IDE POC

## Summary

To illustrates the power of the Astro Cloud IDE, I created a POC using the Astro Cloud IDE to pull a basket of stocks (using the Polygon API), store the resulting payload for each stock as a DataFrame, and update a presentation-grade table in an RDS endpoint (running in AWS). This POC leverages a few tools (native to Astro), that I haven’t used much in the past:

- Astro Cloud IDE
- Astro Python SDK

This document outlines the requirements for this POC, and the steps that I took to build out the project and the pipeline in the Astro Cloud IDE. Enjoy!

## Requirements
To help shape the scope of this POC, I set the following requirements for this project:

- Must use the Astro Cloud IDE *exclusively* to create a data pipeline
- When buiding the pipeline, a "Python", "Warehouse SQL", and "PostgresOperator" cell will be used 
- The resulting data pipeline must be idempotent and deterministic
- Credentials must be securely stored, without configuring a secrets backend

## Building out the Pipeline

To create this POC, I used a free trial of Astro Cloud, as well as my personal AWS account. After logging in to Astronomer, I don’t think that it took more than 60 seconds get set up in Astro Cloud (impressive). For reference (and I know that the services are different in nature), it took more than four hours for Delaware North to spin up our Databricks workspaces earlier this year.

It was a little bit weird not having to spin up a deployment, but I created a "Project" that included sample pipelines, so I could get a feel for the Astro Cloud IDE development experience. This is EXACTLY the kind of tool that Data Scientists and skilled Data Analysts would be drooling over. I thought it was smart to call the processes created and defined in the Cloud IDE “pipelines”, rather than “DAGs”. All data professionals know what a data pipeline, while using the term "DAGs" adds an additional layer of complexity that isn’t needed for this type of product.

One of the things that was really easy was storing environment variables. I created a Polygon API token, which I wanted to store as a masked Airflow variable. 30 seconds later, I was done. I then typed the following code in a Python cell:

```python
import os

POLYGON_API_KEY: str = os.getenv("POLYGON_API_KEY")
```

Boom - environment variable securely stored. No need to configure AWS Secrets Manager, or another secrets backend.

While I was fishing around in this part of the UI, I also noticed the “Requirements” and “Connection” section - very cool “lite” versions of the same tooling in a traditional Airflow deployment. I added `requests` to the requirements section, and then almost opened a web-browser tab to find the version to “pin” the requirement. Before I could, I noticed this was already populated in a drop-down by in the UI. Come on, that’s awesome. When I later added a Postgres cell, the "Requirements" section was updated without a single click. Awesome functionality for non-data engineers looking to build production-grade data pipelines.

For this basic POC, I took an ELT approach, so I could use both a “Warehouse SQL” and “PostgresOperator” cells to store and transform my data in an RDS endpoint. These were incredibly easy to use, and the mix of the Astro Python SDK tooling and traditional operators was seamless. Once I had built and tested the SQL cells, I connected a GitHub repo to my project, and committed the work that I had done. The process was easy as it gets, and from end-to-end, the entire project only took about 3 hours.

## Lessons Learned

Working in the Astro Cloud IDE was a completely different experience than working in a traditional, managed-Airflow setting. I loved the data science-esque workflow, and the ease of working in an Airflow-lite environment. One of my favorite parts was the "porting" of the Cloud IDE notebook to a DAG definition; with just a few clicks of a button, I was basically ready to ship my pipeline into an Astronomer deployment. Pretty darn nifty!

One thing that I struggled on was using some of the templated fields that I rely on when building DAGs in the traditional Airflow environment. For example, I wanted to use the `ds` field when building URLs for my calls to the Polygon API. However, I couldn’t quite figure out how to retrieve this value exclusively in the Cloud IDE using a "Python" cell, even after about an hour on Google.

Once I had wrapped up my `pull_market_data` project, I wanted to remove the “example” pipeline that had been created when I instantiated my project. I stumbled around on this, and eventually did it in a “backdoor” manner. I cloned the repo locally, and removed the DAG-file that had been created in the `dags/` directory. However, while this removed the DAG from my Airflow project, it was still showing in my Astronomer project.
